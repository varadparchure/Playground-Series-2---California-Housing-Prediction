# California Housing Prediction

Developed a linear regression model using XGBoost and LGBMRegressor to predict house prices based on medium house income, house age and number of bedrooms. Achieved an R^2 value of 0.8 on the test set, indicating that the model was able to explain 80% of the variance in the house prices.
